        <p id="hi">Hi! My name is Vedant and i love to code. In my free time i also design 3d models and then print them on my 3d printer. Another thing i love to do all the time is reading books. You can find all my hobbies on this website, with a few images of characters i like and even some of my 3d printed models.</p>

<p id="reason"> I love 3d printing. I started designing classes in the lockdown and eventually bought a 3D printer. I love to use it in my free time and i even like designing models to print. I like it becuase it is very fun to design models on my computer and just print anyhting i want and i can even find models online. </p>

        <p id="name">Thor</p>
          <img id="thor" src="01e8aa52b1fed0eaa3840d105c328fed.jpeg">
          <p id="whyilike">I like Thor a lot because he can fly and he can control lightning. He also has stormbreaker and Mljonir as his hammes which allow him to fly. He is also very strong and had stopped ragnarok by defeating hela and sartur. I like him because he was able to save asgard from hela.</p>
